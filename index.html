                <p style="text-align: justify;">I study Computer Science as a postgraduate student at Tsinghua University until the summer of 2024. My research interests focus on Distributed Systems, High Performance Computing (HPC), Applied Security, and the system perspectives of Blockchain. I am currently open to Ph.D. programs outside China and internship positions in Beijing. </p>
