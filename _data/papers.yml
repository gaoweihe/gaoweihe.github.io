  image: deflection-1.png
  description: A low-cost, image-based solution to measure bridge deflection using a laser transmitter and a camera-equipped optical screen. By applying image-processing algorithms, the method directly computes deflection while addressing systematic errors (such as lens geometric distortion).

- title: "DChain: Scaling Blockchains through Trust-Minimized Compute Delegation"
  image: dchain-1.png
  description: DChain is a blockchain that enhances scalability and lightweight client participation using Trust-Minimized Compute Delegation (TMCD). TMCD leverages threshold cryptography to reduce resource demands while offloading computations to untrusted servers, maintaining decentralization and security.
